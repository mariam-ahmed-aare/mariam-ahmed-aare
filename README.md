- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mariam-ahmed-aare
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to program cool stuff. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI programming with Python. I want to handmake synths, theremins, and other electronic music instruments. 
            I plan on doing this by becoming proficient in Python and Javascript.
